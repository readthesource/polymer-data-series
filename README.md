Polymer Data Series
===================

## Session 1 : Observing & Binding
#### Summary
[Watch The Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjkp2iZsITs)

An overview of data binding in Polymer Elements, utilization techniques, and
some
gotchas. Then, a more detailed journey through data binding, discussing what is
happening 'under the hood' inside the Polymer framework & it's polyfill source
code.

## Session 2 : Communication & Interaction
### Summary
A walk through of attribute I/O, custom events, storage options, async
resolution, & published API's inside components followed by a code review
discussion of source code behind these topics. Ultimately, we should be able to
piece it all together to better understand communication patterns for
components. 


## Session 3 : Experimentation & Design Choices
### Summary
A discussion of component application implementation challenges in passing data
between various levels of nested components. A advanced walkthrough of different
code techniques for data communication, data structure, & component design
experimentation through Responsibility Driven Design.
